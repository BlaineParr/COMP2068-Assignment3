* Description: This game is a javascript remake of Space Invaders. The player controls a tank
* which can fire bullets at aliens moving towards the player. The player can only have 1 bullet
* on the stage at any time. The aliens move downwards and upwards until they hit the edge of the
* stage; upon hitting the edge they will move left and then begin going the opposite direction of
* the one they were going when they hit the edge. The aliens may fire bolts at the player if
* they are in range. The player's goal is to destroy all of the aliens before they get to the
* player.
